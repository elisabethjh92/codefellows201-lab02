        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>I was born in Bandung, Indonesia, where I spent the vast majority of my childhood until I graduated high school. My family also lived in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for 4 months in 1996 and in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam for 4 months in 2002. Starting in about 5th grade, I discovered a love for competitive swimming and competed with my school's swim team until graduating high school. I also played varsity soccer and basketball throughout my high school years, sang in our school choir, and was an active member of our theatre department. A few weeks after graduating high school, I moved to Seattle on my own to find a job and adjust to life in the US before starting university. After 3 years at university, I chose to work full-time as a nanny after working part-time up to that point. In May of 2016, I sold most of what I owned and took a 2 month solo trip backpacking and camping through Europe. I was accepted a temporary job as a nanny in Finland that July, and ended up staying in Finland until the end of March 2017, when I returned to Seatte. I currently still live in Seattle in a tiny house with my partner and our two cats, Garrus and Tali, and spend the time I'm not in class or at work doing things like hiking, gardening, camping, going to concerts, playing video and tabletop games, reading, cosplaying, and planning out future trips.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>I am currently pursuing a number of goals. Currently, I am focused primarily on successfully completing the Code Fellows bootcamp program. After that, I hope to spend several years working for a tech company before either switching to freelance developer work or finding a company that allows me to work remotely. I then plan to travel the United States with my partner and cats in our tiny house for several years while also conducting doula trainings and childbirth education courses in the communities we stay in while traveling. I also plan to obtain my design certification in Permaculture and do private consulting with communities as well as individuals on setting up permaculture systems.</p> 
            
        <p>One of my other long-term goals is to build an app or platform that connects expecting or new parents with doulas, midwives, doctors, mental health counselors, newborn care specialists, massage therapists, and nannies local to them as well as containing a compilation of childbirth education and general childcare education information and resources.</p>
